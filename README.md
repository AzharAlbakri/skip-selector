# Skip Selector

## Overview
A simple and responsive React component that allows users to compare and select skip (waste container) sizes based on common use cases and pricing. Includes visual suggestions to guide user choices using Font Awesome icons and Tailwind CSS styling.

## My Approach

- **Purpose**: The component offers an intuitive way to compare 4, 6, and 8-yard skips, commonly used for garden waste, driveways, and renovations.
- **Technologies Used**:
  - React (with Vite for fast development)
  - Tailwind CSS (for responsive and modern styling)
  - Font Awesome (via CDN for clean icons)
- **Challenges**:
  - Selecting appropriate icons to clearly represent each data point (like price, size, and suggestions) without cluttering the UI.
  - Ensuring mobile responsiveness using utility-first Tailwind classes.
- **Solutions**:
  - Used flat icons from Font Awesome to represent ðŸ’¡ ideas, ðŸ“¦ skip size, and ðŸ’· pricing.
  - Organized layout with `flex` and `gap` utilities for visual clarity.
- **How to run or test the project locally**:
